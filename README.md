npm i && npm start
```

### start

### release

```sh

Releases the package. Runs tests, lints and builds the project beforehand. If successful, it runs `npm run deploy` to deploy the website on GitHub pages.

This command uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) underneath. The version is automatically inferred from the [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

### deploy

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

Deploy the website to the `gh-pages` branch, updating `https://nomios.io`. Note that it might take a few minutes to update the website due to caching. Alternatively, you may purge the cache manually in CloudFlare.
